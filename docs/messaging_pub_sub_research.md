**Multi Cloud Approach to handle Message Passing**

1. Pub/Sub is a Google's messaging service which allows scalable way of handling large message publishing and subscribing those to react to those messages. Pub/Sub can be used with many ways publishing messages using client libraries such as Node.js, Python or Java. Those messages got stored into Pub/Sub Services and every subscribers notified for those messages.
2. Pub/Sub subscribers can be always running servers or http endpoints which works as webhooks, so whenever message received by Pub/Sub Service, service publish message to webhook and webhook do further processing. 
3. So, planned approach here is to create a Google cloud function which is exposed as a Http endpoint, so frontend will call this endpoint with message data. Then cloud function will parse the message body and publish message to Pub/Sub using client libraries.
4. After Pub/Sub Service receives message, Pub/Sub service publish messages to subscribers in this case it will pass message over http to AWS Lambda which is exposed using AWS Api Gateway.
5. AWS Lambda function will process the message and save details in AWS Dynamo DB.

**Learning Through Research** 

1. Pub/Sub Scalability and Flexibility:
Google Cloud Pub/Sub provides a scalable and efficient way to handle large-scale message publishing and subscribing. It supports client libraries in multiple languages (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.) and offers robust message storage and delivery mechanisms. 

2.Serverless and HTTP Endpoints:
Pub/Sub can trigger actions via HTTP endpoints, which can act as webhooks. This allows for a serverless approach where Cloud Functions in Google Cloud can be exposed as HTTP endpoints to process incoming messages. 

3. Integration with AWS Lambda:
Leveraging AWS Lambda and API Gateway, messages received by Google Cloud Pub/Sub can be further processed. This approach involves using an API Gateway endpoint to invoke an AWS Lambda function, which can process the message and interact with AWS services like DynamoDB. 

4. Multi-Cloud Architecture:
By combining Google Cloud and AWS services, a robust and scalable architecture can be built. This approach leverages the strengths of each cloud provider:

- Google Cloud Pub/Sub for scalable message handling.
- Google Cloud Functions for serverless HTTP endpoints and event-driven functions.
- AWS Lambda for serverless compute.
- AWS API Gateway for creating RESTful APIs to trigger Lambda functions.
- AWS DynamoDB for scalable and high-performance NoSQL database storage.

5. Architectural Considerations:
Designing this multi-cloud architecture involves understanding the interplay between event-driven architectures, serverless computing, and scalable message passing. It requires careful consideration of latency, security, and costs associated with data transfer and compute resources across different cloud providers.
